# Linear Integration Test Documentation

## TEA-26: Test Linear Issue Status Sync with GitHub

### Purpose
This document serves as a test artifact for validating the Linear ↔ GitHub integration workflow.

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Branch Creation
- [x] Created branch: `tea-26-test-linear-github-sync`
- [x] Branch name follows Linear convention
- [ ] Linear issue status should update to "In Progress"

#### 2. Commit Linking
- [ ] Commits with TEA-26 prefix should link to Linear issue
- [ ] Linear should show commit history
- [ ] GitHub should reference Linear issue

#### 3. PR Creation and Linking
- [ ] PR title includes TEA-26 for automatic linking
- [ ] PR description references Linear issue URL
- [ ] Linear should show PR status
- [ ] GitHub should link back to Linear

#### 4. Claude Code Integration
- [ ] @claude mentions in PR comments should trigger GitHub Action
- [ ] Claude should have context of Linear issue requirements
- [ ] Claude responses should reference TEA-26 when appropriate

#### 5. Status Synchronization
- [ ] PR draft → Linear issue remains "In Progress"
- [ ] PR ready for review → Linear issue status updates
- [ ] PR merged → Linear issue moves to "Done"
- [ ] PR closed without merge → Linear issue reverts appropriately

### Expected Integration Points

    A[Linear Issue TEA-26] --> B[Git Branch tea-26-*]
    B --> C[GitHub PR]
    C --> D[Claude Code Action]
    D --> E[Code Implementation]
    E --> F[PR Review & Merge]
    F --> G[Linear Issue Complete]
    
    A -.-> |Auto Status Update| C
    C -.-> |PR Status| A
    F -.-> |Auto Close| A
```

### Success Criteria
- Seamless workflow from Linear planning to GitHub execution
- Automatic status synchronization in both directions
- Claude Code Action integration with Linear context
- Clean audit trail of work across both platforms

### Notes
This is a test implementation - no functional code changes are required.
Focus is on validating the integration workflow and automation.
